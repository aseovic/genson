##Issue tracker##

If you think you have identified a bug in Genson, the best would be to create an issue and provide a minimal example allowing to reproduce it.
You can also report it on the mailing list.

If you would like to see some new feature in Genson, you have the choice between issue tracker and ML. If you have a quite good idea of what you want
then you can directly open an issue.
